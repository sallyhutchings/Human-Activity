# Human-Activity
## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on human activity recognition using smartphones

This project used the data from a study on human activity to produce a tidy data set summarising the mean and standard deviations of feature measurements collected by activity and subject ID.

### In this repository you will find the following files:
1. *README.md:* this document, which gives an overview of the other files in the repository
2. *run_analysis.R:* a script that tranforms human activity data into a summarised tidy data set 
3. *Tidy_data.txt:* the tidy data set produced by the run_analysis.R script containing the mean value for each activity, subject and relevant feature measured
4. *CodeBook.md:* a description of the input data, output data and any transformations or intermediate steps that were performed
